      Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness
      ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East
      Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been
      previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they
      are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found
      that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from
      dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in
      animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection
      include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
      breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause
      pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even
      death. Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include
      regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing,
      thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing
      symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

      According to reported administrative data, 449 756 (4%) children aged
      years were inaccessible during the March 2019 NID. The number increased to
      2 844 197 (28%) in the November 2019 NID and was 2 655 821 (27%) during
      the January 2020 NID. After a 5-month pause in SIAs due to COVID-19, a
      cVDPV2 response campaign with mOPV2 was conducted in July 2020 in the
      eastern region, where 107 768 (10%) of 1 101 740 targeted children were
      inaccessible. During these SIAs, the numbers of children reported as
      accessible but missed because of inadequate campaign quality were 399 969
      (4%) in March 2019, 299 977 (2%) in November 2019 and January 2020 and 22
      035 (2%) in July 2020. Lot quality assurance sampling surveys6 were used
      to assess SIA quality in areas where permitted. This method is more
      accurate than post-SIA monitoring of convenience samples. District SIAs
      are marked as either “passed” at a 90% threshold or “failed” according to
      the number of unvaccinated children among 60 surveyed. The proportion of
      districts with failed SIAs was 29% in April 2019, 15% in November 2019,
      24% in January 2020 and 40% in July 2020.
